# Intelligence and Autonomous Evolution

Synapse-NG is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive system that can learn, evolve, and improve over time. This is made possible by a combination of AI integration and a powerful self-upgrade system.

## AI Agents

Synapse-NG supports the integration of optional AI agents that can analyze the network state and propose optimizations. These agents can be used to automate a wide range of tasks, from resource allocation to network security.

## Self-Upgrade System

The self-upgrade system allows the network to autonomously evolve its own code. This is done through a governance process where nodes can propose and vote on code changes. If a proposal is approved, the new code is deployed in a WASM sandbox for safe execution.

## Network Singularity

The ultimate goal of Synapse-NG is to achieve Network Singularity, a state where the network can autonomously generate and deploy its own code without human intervention. This would represent a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence and would open up a new world of possibilities for decentralized applications.
