# 🧪 The First Task Experiment

## One-Page Summary

---

### What is this?

A **5-minute micro-experiment** that proves a revolutionary principle:

> **Software can reward you automatically for your contributions, without any human approval.**

---

### What you'll do

1. **Find a bug** (or typo, or anything improvable) in Synapse-NG
2. **Create a GitHub issue** documenting it
3. **Claim a task** on the network
4. **Complete it**
5. **Receive Synapse Points + Reputation** automatically

**Total time: 5-10 minutes**

---

### What you'll get

| Reward | Amount | What it means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Synapse Points** | 10 SP | Internal currency of the network |
| **Reputation** | +10 | Increases your voting power |
| **Proof** | Permanent | All nodes agree you did this |

**Most importantly**: You'll experience a system that rewards you **without any manager approving your work**.

---

### What this proves

| Traditional System | Synapse-NG |
|-------------------|------------|
| Manager reviews your work | Contract self-executes |
| Approval process takes days | Instant reward transfer |
| Someone decides if you deserve payment | Math decides |
| Your contribution might be forgotten | Permanent, immutable record |
| Hierarchical trust | Trustless system |

---

### The Big Idea

If we can prove this works for a **10 SP task** (finding a bug), it works for:

- **100 SP tasks** (fixing a bug)
- **1000 SP tasks** (building a feature)
- **10,000 SP tasks** (architecting a system)

**Everything scales from this one principle.**

### How to participate

#### Option 1: Automated Test (See it work)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/synapse-ng.git
cd synapse-ng
docker-compose up -d
./test_first_task_experiment.sh
```

Watch the system automatically transfer value between nodes.

#### Option 2: Real Contribution (Do it yourself)
```bash
# Follow QUICKSTART.md
cat QUICKSTART.md
```

Earn your first Synapse Points by finding a real bug.

---

### Why this matters

**Today**: Your contributions are rewarded by managers, committees, bosses, gatekeepers.

**Tomorrow**: Your contributions are rewarded by math, consensus, and self-executing contracts.

This isn't about blockchain. This isn't about cryptocurrency.

**This is about removing human gatekeepers from value creation.**

---

### The Experiment

- **Hypothesis**: A decentralized network can auto-reward contributions without central authority
- **Method**: Create task → Complete task → Verify rewards transferred
- **Success Criteria**: All nodes agree on new state, contributor received SP + reputation
- **Time**: 5 minutes
- **Cost**: $0 (runs locally in Docker)

---

### What people say after trying it

> *"Wait, it just... gave me points? No one approved it?"*

> *"This is wild. I can see my reputation on all 3 nodes."*

> *"So if I do more tasks, I earn more points? And those points give me voting power?"*

**Yes. That's the entire point.**

1. **[Read QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - 5 minute guide
2. **[Read the full experiment doc](docs/FIRST_TASK_EXPERIMENT.md)** - Complete details
3. **[Join the community](#)** - Discord/Telegram links
4. **Run the test** - See it work in 5 minutes

### The Core Principle

```
┌─────────────┐
│ Contribution│
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       │ (no approval needed)
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│    Value    │
└─────────────┘
```

**No middleman. No approval. Just execution.**

---

### Status

- ✅ System built
- ✅ Experiment designed
- ✅ Documentation written
- ✅ Automated test ready
- 🎯 **Waiting for first real contributor**

**That could be you.**
