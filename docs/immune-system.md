# Immune System

Synapse-NG has a built-in immune system that allows it to proactively monitor its own health and take corrective action when problems are detected. This self-healing mechanism is essential for the long-term stability and resilience of the network.

## Automated Health Monitoring

The immune system continuously tracks a wide range of network metrics, including:

*   **Latency:** The time it takes for messages to travel between nodes.
*   **Connectivity:** The number of active connections between nodes.
*   **Message Loss:** The percentage of messages that are lost in transit.

## Autonomous Diagnosis

When the immune system detects a problem, it uses AI-powered diagnosis to determine the root cause. This allows the network to identify and address issues before they become critical.

## Proactive Remedies

Once a problem has been diagnosed, the immune system can generate a governance proposal to fix it. This allows the network to autonomously heal itself without human intervention. The entire process, from detection to remedy, is called the **homeostatic cycle**.
