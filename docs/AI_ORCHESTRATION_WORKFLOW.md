---

## 🎯 Overview

Synapse-NG is not just a decentralized network—it's a **proof of concept for a new way of building software**. This document explains the unique development workflow that created a system of extraordinary depth and coherence in record time.

**The Principle**: A skilled **Human Orchestrator** guides multiple **AI Agents** through complex, multi-phase implementation work using structured prompts, iterative refinement, and continuous validation.

---

## 👤 The Role of the Human Orchestrator

### Not a Traditional Developer

The orchestrator is **not writing most of the code**. Instead, they:

✅ **Architect** - Design system architecture and data flows  
✅ **Guide** - Craft detailed prompts that AI agents execute  
✅ **Validate** - Review AI output for correctness and coherence  
✅ **Iterate** - Refine through cycles of feedback  
✅ **Integrate** - Ensure components work together harmoniously  
✅ **Document** - Capture knowledge and rationale  

### Critical Skills

1. **Systems Thinking** - Understanding complex interconnected systems
2. **Prompt Engineering** - Crafting precise, actionable instructions
3. **Quality Assurance** - Spotting inconsistencies and gaps
4. **Domain Expertise** - Deep knowledge of the problem space
5. **Patience** - Iteration and refinement take time

---

## 🤖 The AI as Thought Partner

### What AI Excels At

✅ **Code Generation** - Writing boilerplate, algorithms, schemas  
✅ **Documentation** - Creating comprehensive, well-structured docs  
✅ **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying common patterns in requirements  
✅ **Consistency** - Maintaining style and naming conventions  
✅ **Exploration** - Proposing alternative approaches  

### What AI Struggles With

❌ **Long-term Vision** - Maintaining coherent architecture across sessions  
❌ **Context Switching** - Remembering decisions made weeks ago  
❌ **Implicit Knowledge** - Understanding unstated requirements  
❌ **Trade-off Judgment** - Making nuanced engineering decisions  
❌ **Integration** - Ensuring all pieces fit together  

**Solution**: The orchestrator provides vision, context, and judgment. The AI provides execution.

## 📐 The Workflow in Practice

### Phase Structure

Each major feature follows this pattern:

```
1. ARCHITECTURE PHASE
   └─> Human: Designs system, data structures, flows
       AI: Challenges assumptions, suggests alternatives

2. PROMPTING PHASE
   └─> Human: Writes detailed "super prompt"
       AI: Asks clarifying questions

3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
   └─> AI: Generates code, tests, documentation
       Human: Reviews, provides feedback

4. INTEGRATION PHASE
   └─> Human: Tests integration, finds gaps
       AI: Fills gaps, fixes bugs

5. DOCUMENTATION PHASE
   └─> AI: Creates comprehensive docs
       Human: Validates technical accuracy

6. ITERATION PHASE
   └─> Cycle through 3-5 until satisfactory
```

### The "Super Prompt" Technique

**Key Innovation**: Instead of many small requests, create **one comprehensive prompt** with:

1. **Context** - Full background and current system state
2. **Objective** - What you want to achieve
3. **Specifications** - Detailed requirements, constraints
4. **Examples** - Concrete use cases
5. **Deliverables** - Exact outputs expected

**Example Structure**:

```markdown
# SUPER PROMPT: Implement Common Tools System

## Context
Synapse-NG currently has channels, tasks, governance, and economy.
We need to enable the network to collectively own shared resources
like API keys and service credentials.

## Objective
Implement a "Common Tools" system that allows:
1. Democratic acquisition of tools via governance
2. Encrypted credential storage
3. Secure execution with three-layer authorization
4. Automatic monthly maintenance from treasury

## Current State
[Paste relevant code snippets, data structures]

## Specifications
### Data Structure
```json
{
  "common_tools": {
    "tool_id": {...}
  }
}
```

### Security Requirements
- Credentials encrypted with AESGCM
- Decryption only at execution time
- Never log or persist decrypted credentials

### Integration Points
- Governance: `acquire_common_tool` operation
- Treasury: Monthly cost deduction
- Tasks: `required_tools` field (task_v2 schema)

## Deliverables
1. Updated data structures
2. Encryption/decryption functions
3. Governance integration
4. Execution endpoint with authorization
5. Maintenance loop (background task)
6. Complete test suite
7. Documentation

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- Security audit clean
- Documentation comprehensive
```

**Benefits**:
- AI has full context in one shot
- Reduces back-and-forth clarifications
- Higher quality initial output
- Easier to validate completeness

---

## 🔄 Iteration and Refinement

### The Reality of AI Development

**First attempt**: 60-70% correct  
**Second iteration**: 85-90% correct  
**Third iteration**: 95-98% correct  
**Final polish**: 99%+ correct  

**Key Insight**: Expect iteration. Don't aim for perfection on first try.

### Effective Feedback Loop

```
1. AI GENERATES
   └─> Code, docs, tests

2. HUMAN TESTS
   ├─> Run code
   ├─> Check logic
   ├─> Verify integration
   └─> Review docs

3. HUMAN PROVIDES SPECIFIC FEEDBACK
   ❌ Bad: "This doesn't work"
   ✅ Good: "Line 347: decrypt_credentials() is called but never defined. 
            Need to implement AESGCM decryption with HKDF key derivation."

4. AI REFINES
   └─> Fixes specific issues

5. REPEAT until satisfactory
```

## 📁 The `/prompts` Directory (Conceptual)

While Synapse-NG doesn't currently have a `/prompts` directory in the repo, the concept is powerful:

### What It Would Contain

```
/prompts
├── architecture/
│   ├── reputation_v2_design.md
│   ├── common_tools_design.md
│   └── governance_architecture.md
├── implementation/
│   ├── reputation_v2_implementation.md
│   ├── common_tools_implementation.md
│   └── auction_system_implementation.md
├── testing/
│   ├── reputation_v2_tests.md
│   └── common_tools_tests.md
└── documentation/
    ├── governance_consolidation.md
    └── economy_documentation.md
```

### Value

✅ **Reproducibility** - Anyone can recreate the process  
✅ **Learning** - Others learn prompt engineering techniques  
✅ **Transparency** - Decisions and rationale are captured  
✅ **Iteration History** - See how prompts evolved

## 🧩 Real-World Example: Common Tools Implementation

### Phase 1: Architecture (Human-Led)

**Orchestrator's Vision**:
```
The network needs to own shared resources. Traditional approach:
each node gets their own API key. Our approach: network collectively
owns ONE key, stores it encrypted, provides secure execution.

Design constraints:
- Must integrate with existing governance (proposals)
- Must integrate with treasury (monthly payments)
- Must be secure (encryption, authorization)
- Must be automatic (maintenance loop)
```

**AI Contribution**: Suggests AESGCM + HKDF for encryption

---

### Phase 2: Super Prompt (Human-Crafted)

Orchestrator creates comprehensive prompt (see example above) with:
- Full context of current system
- Detailed specifications
- Integration requirements
- Security constraints
- Deliverables list

---

### Phase 3: Implementation (AI-Executed)

AI generates:
- `common_tools` data structure in network state
- `encrypt_credentials()` function
- `decrypt_credentials()` function  
- `/tools/{tool_id}/execute` endpoint
- Three-layer authorization logic
- `common_tools_maintenance_loop()` background task
- Governance integration for `acquire_common_tool`

---

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (Human-Led)

Orchestrator finds issues:
- ❌ Encryption key derivation not deterministic across nodes
- ❌ Authorization missing "tool status" check
- ❌ Maintenance loop doesn't handle suspended tools

Provides specific feedback to AI.

---

### Phase 5: Refinement (AI-Executed)

AI fixes:
- ✅ Uses `channel_id` for deterministic key derivation
- ✅ Adds status check to authorization
- ✅ Implements suspension logic in maintenance loop

---

### Phase 6: Documentation (AI-Generated, Human-Validated)

AI creates:
- COMMON_TOOLS_SYSTEM.md (832 lines)
- COMMON_TOOLS_TEST_DESIGN.md
- Integration with ECONOMY.md

Orchestrator validates technical accuracy.

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Orchestrators

1. **Start with Architecture** - Design before implementation
2. **Write Super Prompts** - Comprehensive context, clear deliverables
3. **Validate Rigorously** - Test generated code thoroughly
4. **Iterate Patiently** - 3-4 cycles is normal
5. **Document Everything** - Capture rationale and decisions
6. **Maintain Vision** - Keep long-term coherence

### For AI Interaction

1. **Be Specific** - "Line 347 is broken" > "This doesn't work"
2. **Provide Context** - Always include relevant code/docs
3. **Request Explanations** - Ask AI to explain its approach
4. **Challenge Assumptions** - Don't accept first solution
