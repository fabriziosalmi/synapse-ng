## 🚀 How to Execute

### Option 1: Automated Test (Demo)
```bash
# Start network
docker-compose up -d
sleep 15

# Run test
./test_first_task_experiment.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ CHECKPOINT 1: Balance frozen
# ✅ CHECKPOINT 2: Task claimed
# ✅ CHECKPOINT 3: Rewards transferred
# 🎉 EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFUL!
```

### Option 2: Real Contributor (Production)

**Step 1: You (Creator)**
```bash
# Start network
docker-compose up -d

# Create task
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/tasks?channel=dev_ui" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Trovare il primo bug in Synapse-NG",
    "description": "Esplora il sistema e documenta il primo comportamento inatteso.",
    "reward": 10,
    "tags": ["testing", "bug-hunting", "first-contribution"]
  }'

# Save task_id from response
```

**Step 2: Invite Contributor**

Send them:
```
🧪 Esperimento Synapse-NG

Task: "Find the first bug"
Reward: 10 SP + reputation
Time: 5-10 minutes

Quick Start: https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/synapse-ng/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md

Task ID: <paste_task_id>

What to do:
1. Clone repo
2. Find any bug/typo/improvement
3. Create GitHub issue
4. Let me know when done
```

**Step 3: Guide Them**

```bash
# After they create issue, guide them:

# Claim
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/tasks/<task_id>/claim?channel=dev_ui"

# Progress
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/tasks/<task_id>/progress?channel=dev_ui"

# Complete
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/tasks/<task_id>/complete?channel=dev_ui"
```

**Step 4: Verify Together**

```bash
# Check their balance
NODE2_ID=$(curl -s http://localhost:8002/state | jq -r '.global.nodes | keys[0]')
curl -s http://localhost:8002/state | jq ".global.nodes.\"$NODE2_ID\".balance"

# Check reputation
curl -s http://localhost:8002/reputations | jq ".\"$NODE2_ID\""

# Verify consensus
curl -s http://localhost:8001/state | jq ".global.nodes.\"$NODE2_ID\".balance"
curl -s http://localhost:8003/state | jq ".global.nodes.\"$NODE2_ID\".balance"
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

The experiment succeeds if:

1. ✅ **Transfer**: Creator lost 10 SP, Contributor gained ~10 SP
2. ✅ **Reputation**: Contributor gained +10 reputation
3. ✅ **Consensus**: All 3 nodes agree on balances and reputation
4. ✅ **No Approval**: No human approved the task completion
5. ✅ **Value**: The bug report has real value for the project

---

## 📊 What to Measure

### Timing
- Time from task creation to claim: _____ seconds
- Time from complete to reward visible: _____ seconds
- Total experiment duration: _____ minutes

### Consensus
- Balance discrepancy between nodes: _____ SP (should be 0)
- Reputation discrepancy: _____ (should be 0)

### Experience (Ask Contributor)
- Clarity of process: _____/10
- Trust in system: _____/10
- Willingness to repeat: _____/10

---

## 🎓 What This Proves

### For the Contributor
- **"I provided value, I received value"** - Direct exchange, no intermediary
- **"No one judged me"** - The math decided, not a person
- **"My reputation is real"** - Visible and verifiable across the network

### For the Creator
- **"I incentivized useful behavior"** - Paid 10 SP, got a bug report
- **"The system executed automatically"** - No manual approval needed

### For the Network
- **"Consensus works"** - All nodes agree on the new state
- **"The economy is real"** - SP has value because it incentivizes behavior
- **"The system is autonomous"** - No central authority needed

---

## 🔄 Iterations

### After First Success

**Scale up:**
- Invite 5-10 contributors
- Create tasks with varying rewards (5 SP, 20 SP, 50 SP)
- Try auction-based tasks
- Try composite tasks with teams

**Measure:**
- How many contributors complete 2+ tasks?
- What's the average time-to-completion?
- Do contributors trust the system more after multiple tasks?

### If It Fails

**Debug:**
- Where did consensus break?
- Was it a timing issue (propagation delay)?
- Was it a logic bug (balance calculation)?

**Fix and Retry:**
- Create issue for the bug
- Fix it
- Document the fix
- Run experiment again

---

## 📢 Communicate the Results

### If Successful

**Post to:**
- GitHub Discussions
- Twitter/X thread
- Discord/Telegram
- Blog post
- Video demo

**Message:**
```
🎉 We just proved a principle:

A decentralized system can automatically reward contributions
without any human approval.

Here's what happened:
1. Task created: "Find a bug" (10 SP)
2. Contributor found bug, documented it
3. System automatically transferred 10 SP + reputation
4. All nodes verified the transfer
5. No manager involved

This is not a demo. This is a new way of working.

[Link to experiment doc]
[Link to GitHub repo]
```

### If Failed

**Post to:**
- GitHub issue
- Discord/Telegram (ask for help)

**Message:**
```
🧪 Experiment update:

We found a bug in the experiment itself! (Meta, right?)

[Brief description of what went wrong]

Opening an issue to track the fix. If anyone wants to help debug,
that would be the first real contribution to the project!

## 🧬 Philosophy

This is not "just a test".

This is the **empirical demonstration** that:

> A digital organism can self-organize, auto-incentivize useful behavior,
> and reach deterministic consensus without central authority.

If this micro-step works, we have proof the principle is valid.

**Everything else is scale.**
