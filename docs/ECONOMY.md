# Economy

Synapse-NG has a built-in economic system that provides incentives for contribution and allows the network to manage its own resources.

## Synapse Points (SP)

Synapse Points (SP) are the internal currency of the network. They are used to reward nodes for completing tasks and participating in governance. SP is not a cryptocurrency and has no value outside of the Synapse-NG network.

## Auction System

Tasks in Synapse-NG are allocated through an auction system. When a new task is created, nodes can bid on it. The node with the winning bid is assigned the task and is rewarded with SP upon completion.

## Common Tools System

The Common Tools system allows the network to collectively own and manage shared resources, such as API keys, services, and credentials. These resources are financed by the network's treasury and can be used by any node that has been granted permission.
