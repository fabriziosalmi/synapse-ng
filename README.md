**A self-governing, self-funding, self-evolving decentralized network.**

Synapse-NG is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that functions as a living digital organism. It can think, make decisions, own resources, and evolve without central control. Each node is an autonomous agent, and together they form a collective intelligence.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get a 3-node network running in under 5 minutes with Docker.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/synapse-ng.git
    cd synapse-ng
    ```

2.  **Start the network:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

3.  **Verify the network status:**
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8001/state | jq '.global.nodes | length'
    ```
    You should see an output of `3`.

4.  **Run the test suite:**
    ```bash
    ./test_suite.sh
    ```
