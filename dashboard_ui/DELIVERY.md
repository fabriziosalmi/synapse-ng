```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Three Consciousness Panels

#### 🫀 Panel 1: Homeostatic System
**"Come si sente l'organismo?"**

**Components**:
- ✅ 4 vital signs cards with traffic lights (latency, peers, consensus, messages)
- ✅ Active diagnoses list with severity indicators
- ✅ Autonomous remedy proposals from Immune System
- ✅ Real-time metric comparison with health targets

**Status Calculation**:
```javascript
if (value <= target) → 🟢 Healthy
if (value <= target * 1.5) → 🟡 Warning  
if (value > target * 1.5) → 🔴 Critical
```

#### 🧠 Panel 2: Nervous System
**"Cosa sta decidendo l'organismo?"**

**Components**:
- ✅ 4-column Kanban (Open, Voting, Ratifying, Closed)
- ✅ Contextual vote simulator with reputation calculation
- ✅ Treasury monitoring (multiple channels)
- ✅ Proposal filtering by type (config, code_upgrade, treasury)

**Vote Weight Formula**:
```
base_weight = 1.0
bonus_weight = Σ(specializations matching proposal tags)
total_weight = base_weight + bonus_weight
influence = (bonus_weight / base_weight) * 100%
```

#### 🧬 Panel 3: Evolutionary Genome
**"Come sta pensando di evolversi l'organismo?"**

**Components**:
- ✅ Evolutionary timeline with impact metrics
- ✅ Evolution statistics (generations, success rate, applied upgrades)
- ✅ Generated solutions viewer with WASM inspector
- ✅ Code viewer with Rust syntax highlighting

**Timeline Events**:
- 🟢 Approved (executed)
- 🔴 Rejected
- 🟡 Pending (open/voting/ratifying)

---

## 🔌 API Integration

### Endpoint: `/state`

The dashboard polls the node's `/state` endpoint every 10 seconds.

**Data Accessed**:
```javascript
synapseAPI.getHealthMetrics()        // Vital signs
synapseAPI.getDiagnoses()            // Active health issues
synapseAPI.getProposals()            // All governance proposals
synapseAPI.getCodeUpgradeProposals() // Evolution timeline
synapseAPI.getTreasury()             // Treasury balances
synapseAPI.getReputation(nodeId)     // Node reputation
synapseAPI.calculateVoteWeight()     // Vote simulator
```

### Real-time Updates

```
Connect → Poll every 10s → Update UI → Emit events → Monitors react
```

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Traffic Light Health Indicators
Visual status at a glance - no need to read numbers.

### ✅ Contextual Vote Simulator (FEATURE CHIAVE)
**The crown jewel of the dashboard.**

**Flow**:
1. User clicks any proposal
2. Enters their node ID
3. Dashboard calculates:
   - Base weight (1.0)
   - Bonus weight (from specializations)
   - Total weight
   - Influence percentage

**Example Output**:
> *"Your experience in 'security' gives your vote **250% more influence** on this decision."*

### ✅ Code Viewer with Syntax Highlighting
View generated Rust code with:
- WASM binary size
- SHA256 hash (verification)
- Estimated performance improvement
- Full source code (syntax highlighted)

### ✅ Evolutionary Timeline
Visual history of all code upgrades:
- Approved (with impact: "↑ 32% improvement")
- Rejected (with reason)
- Pending (with voting progress)

## 🧪 Testing the Dashboard

### Test Scenario 1: Healthy Organism

```bash
# Start node and open dashboard
./launch_dashboard.sh

# Expected:
# - All vital signs 🟢 green
# - No diagnoses
# - Some governance proposals
# - Treasury balances visible
```

### Test Scenario 2: Unhealthy Organism (Trigger Issue)

```python
# Create artificial latency issue
# (This would be done via network simulation)

# Expected:
# - Latency card turns 🟡 or 🔴
# - Diagnosis appears in "Active Diagnoses"
# - If persistent (3+ cycles): "🧬 Generating algorithmic solution"
# - Autonomous remedy appears in "Autonomous Remedies"
```

### Test Scenario 3: Code Evolution

```bash
# Trigger evolutionary engine (after 3 failures)

# Expected:
# - New event in evolutionary timeline
# - Statistics update (total generations +1)
# - Solution appears in "Proposed Cures"
# - Click "View Code" → See Rust source
```

### Test Scenario 4: Vote Simulation

```
1. Click any proposal in Nervous System panel
2. Click "🗳️ Simulate My Vote Weight"
3. Enter "node-1"
4. Click "Calculate My Influence"

Expected:
- Base Weight: 1.0
- Bonus Weight: (depends on specializations)
- Total Weight: Base + Bonus
- Explanation text shows influence increase
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Design Philosophy
> *"Non mostrare solo dati, ma rivelare l'anima della macchina"*

The dashboard achieves this through:
- **Anthropomorphization**: Three "consciousness" panels mirror human systems
- **Biotech aesthetic**: Medical monitors give organism-like feel
- **Traffic lights**: Universal language for health status
- **Contextual information**: Not just "what", but "why" and "how"

### Technical Philosophy
- **Zero dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works even if features missing
- **Fail-safe**: Shows informative messages instead of crashing
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new panels/features
